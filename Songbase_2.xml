Now we're on the steps of mercy

How long, before You drench the barren land?
How long, before we see Your righteous hand?
How long, before Your name is lifted high?
How long, before the weeping turns to songs of joy.

Lord we know Your heart is broken
By the evil that You see
And you've stayed Your hand of judgement
For You plan to set men free.
But the land is still in darkness
And we've fled from what is right
We have failed the silent children
Who will never see the light.

But I know a day is coming
When the deaf will hear His voice
When the blind will see their Saviour
And the lame will leap for joy.
When the widow finds a Husband
Who will always love His bride
And the orphan finds a Father
Who will never leave her side.

How long, before Your radiance lifts our eyes?
How long, before Your fragrance fills the air?

Set me apart, I know You're drawing   me to Yourself
Lead me Lord, I pray.

Take me, mould me, use me, fill  me,
I give my life to the Potter's hand.

But for now I marvel at Your saving grace

The full release of Your promise

Turn to us Lord and touch us 
Make us strong in Your might 
Overcome our weakness

Declaring the word of the Lord 
And these are the days of
Your servant Moses 
Righteousness being restored 
And though these are days of great trial Of famine and darkness and sword 
Still we are a voice in the desert crying
Prepare ye the way of the Lord

Behold He comes riding on the clouds 
Shining like the sun at the trumpet call 
Lift your voice the year of jubilee 
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes 

These are the days of Ezekiel 
The dry bones becoming as flesh 
And these are the days
Of your servant David 
Rebuilding the temple of praise 
And these are the days of the harvest 
The fields are as white in your world 
And we are the labourers 
In your vineyard 
Declaring the word of the Lord

Behold He comes riding on the clouds 
Shining like the sun at the trumpet call 
Lift your voice the year of jubilee 
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes

The Lamb that was slain 
You ascended to heaven
And ever more will reign 
At the end of the age

The Giver of life was He.
Yet my Lord was despised 
And rejected of men,
This Jesus of Calvary.

Chorus
He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

Price for healing was paid, 
As those cruel stripes were made,
Within Pilate's judgment hall.
Now His suffering affords perfect healing for all. 
This wonderful Healer's mine.

Came the leper to Christ, 
Saying, "Surely I know
That Thou, Lord, canst make me whole."
When his great faith was seen, Jesus said, "Yes, I will,"
And touched him and made him clean.

Chorus
He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

He has healed my sick soul, made me every whit whole,
And He'll do the same for you.
He's the same yesterday and today and for aye,
This Healer of men today.

And round His pierced feet 
Fair flowers of paradise extend

A day I will never forget
After I wandered in darkness away
Jesus my saviour I met
O, what a tender compassionate Friend
He met the need of my heart
Shadows dispelling with joy I am telling
He made all the darkness depart

Heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul
When at the cross
My saviour made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
When heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul

Born of the Spirit with life from above
Into God's family divine
Justified fully thro' Calvary's love
O what a standing is mine
And the transaction so quickly was made
When as a sinner I came
Took of the offer of grace He did proffer
He saved me O praise His dear name


Now I've a hope that will surely endure
After the passing of time
I have a future in heaven for sure
There in those mansions sublime
And it's because of that wonderful day
When at the cross I believed
Riches eternal and blessings supernal
From His precious hand I received

Heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul
When at the cross
My saviour made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day

Whose body crucified high on Calvary's tree 
Whose redemptive blood makes way for me 
I now give everything 

To the King who came in the form of a child 
All powerful God and yet so mild 
Whose obedience shows the way for me
I humbly come to Thee 

To the King alone I will give my life 
To the King I will sing both day and night 
To the Lamb of God who has paid the price 
To the King alone, I will give my life 

To the King the one true royalty 
The King He has befriended me 
But greater still He lives in me 
I give Him everything 

To the King alone I will give my life 
To the King I will sing both day and night 
To the Lamb of God who has paid the price 
To the King alone, I will give my life

Always, only, for my King.
Take my lips, and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee.

Take my silver and my gold; 
Not a mite would I withhold.
Take my intellect, and use
Every power as Thou shalt choose.

Take my will, and make it Thine;  
It shall be no longer mine.
Take my heart, it is Thine own;  
It shall be Thy royal throne.
                
Take my love, my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure store.
Take myself, and I will be
Ever only all for Thee.

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">There’s a road that is open before us 
And it leads to a world unknown; 
Oft have we pondered its pleasures 
And pictured the heavenly throne. 

We have thought of myriad angels, 
Of harps and of jubilant song; 
We have pictured our Lord and our Saviour 
Where they praise Him all the day long. 

But now our heavenly Guide
Is taking us upward from earth, 
And we’re entering spiritual hallways 
With the sense of a spiritual birth. 

There’s a sensing of realms that we know not 
An acute awareness of need, 
To learn of the things of the Spirit, 
To sit at God’s table and feed. 

The Lamb whom we pictured we see not 
With the eyes of our flesh or our mind, 
But we sense His ineffable nearness 
As He opens the eyes of the blind. 

Instruct us, our God and our Father, 
As we move in this heavenly place;
Teach us the laws of the kingdom 
As we bathe in Thy glory and grace. 

Set our minds firmly on Jesus 
As we search for that radiant face; 
Let our feet go fervently forward 
As we seek for that uttermost place. 

Chorus
Sing we now the song of Jesus, 
Let the vaults of heaven ring, 
Let all nations come and worship 
At the throne of heaven’s king. 

Seek we now the joy of Jesus, 
Seek the deepest wells of life; 
Let us rise and take the kingdom, 
Rise victorious in the strife.</attribute>

Within my heart is ringing.

And He walks with me and He talks to me 
And He tells me I am His own

I'd stay in the garden with Him
Though the night around me be calling
But He bids me go thro' the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling.

Come in all Your sovereign power;
This is the day the Lord has chosen,
This is the day and this the hour. 

Come, gentle Spirit, we await You: 
Come in all your holy grace; 
Show us now the things of Jesus, 
Show us now His Blessed face. 

Come, Holy Spirit, we can feel You 
Falling on us like a shower; 
Bless we now the name of Jesus, 
Thrill we now with holy power. 

Come, Holy Spirit, we can sense You: 
Coming like the gentle rain; 
Love a mantle falling on us
Sing we now our glad refrain. 

Take the things that shade His glory:
Pierce the clouds that lie between; 
Convict of sin, O Holy Spirit, 
That His glory may be seen. 

Come, Holy Spirit, to release us: 
Bind our wounds and set us free; 
Break the cruel bands of darkness, 
As thy glorious light we see. 

Lift the burdens, Holy Spirit: 
Heal the scars and staunch the pain, 
By the precious blood of Jesus,
Through the Lamb who once was slain. 

Chorus 
Sing we now the song of Jesus, 
Praise we now the stricken Lamb;
Unctioned by the Holy Spirit, 
Praise we now the great I Am.</attribute>

I have a strong a perfect plea 
A great high priest whose name is Love 
Who ever lives and pleads for me 
My name is graven on His hands
My name is written on His heart 
I know that while in heaven stands 
No tongue can bid me thence depart x2
 
When Satan tempts me to despair 
And tells me of the guilt within 
Upwards I look and see Him there 
Who made an end to all my sin 
Because the sinless Saviour died 
My sinful soul is counted free 
For God the just is satisfied 
To look on him and pardon me x2 

Behold Him there the risen lamb 
My perfect spotless righteousness 
The great unchangeable I Am 
The King of glory and of grace 
One with Himself I cannot die 
My soul is purchased with His blood 
My life is hid with Christ on high 
With Christ my Saviour and my God x2

Brought the sinner near to Your throne

Your Majesty I can but bow

Let angel minds inquire no more

Emptied Himself of all but love
And bled for Adam's helpless race

Fast bound in sin and nature's night

I woke the dungeon flamed with light 
My chains fell off my heart was free

How vast beyond all measure

As wounds which mar the Chosen One 
Bring many sons to glory 

Behold the man upon a cross 
My sin upon His shoulders 
Ashamed I hear my mocking voice 
Call out among the scoffers 
It was my sin that held Him there 
Until it was accomplished 
His dying breath has brought me life 
I know that it is finished

I will not boast in anything 
No gifts no power no wisdom 
But I will boast in Jesus Christ

Why should I gain from His reward 
I cannot give an answer

On a hill nearby on a rugged cross 
Justice met grace

I can kneel and make my petition known 
I can go into the holy of holies
And although I'm just a common man 
Because of God's redemption plan 
I can boldly approach the throne 

For the blood of sacrifices 
Is now no longer required 
For the blood of Christ God's spotless lamb 
Has opened heaven's door 
Allowing us to enter in

While Jesus stands and whispers 
Follow me follow me

Should set His love upon the sons of men

When Bethlehem's manger was His only home 
And that He lived at nazareth and laboured 
And so the Saviour, 
Saviour of the world is come 

I cannot tell how silently He suffered 
As with His peace he graced this place of tears 
Or how His heart upon the cross was broken 
The crown of pain to three and thirty years 
But this I know He heals the broken-hearted 
And stays our sin and calms our lurking fear 
And lifts the burden from the heavy-laden 
For yet the Saviour Saviour of the world is here 

I cannot tell how He will win the nations 
How He will claim His earthly heritage 
How satisfy the needs and aspirations 
Of east and west of sinner and of sage 
But this I know all flesh shall see His glory 
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown 
And some glad day 
His sun shall shine in splendour 
When He the Saviour,
Saviour of the world is known 

I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship 
When at his bidding every storm is stilled 
Or who can say how great the jubilation 
When all the hearts of men with love are filled 
But this I know the skies will thrill with rapture 
And myriad myriad human voices sing 
And earth to heaven 
And heaven to earth will answer

The words of God are sounding, sounding on the air
Prepare the ground for battle, for God's day has come
Drive back the powers of darkness and march to sounding drum

Long years the land lay shrouded, shrouded in defeat
There was the breath of evil there was satan;s seat
But now the winds are blowing, and darkness flees the plain
The power of God is flowing and many are the slain

Hark to the sounding trumpet, hark to the blaring horn
Now is the day of battle, when many shall be born
Sing now the song of Zion, sing loud the swelling praise
Sing of the glorious lion and loud the anthems raise

Praise Him, praise Him Lord of Glory
Praise Him, praise Him Lord of life
See He rides in triumph victorious in the strife

Crown Him Lord of Glory, Crown Him Lord of life
See the Lord of battles victorious in the strife</attribute>

The Spirit and the Bride cry out to You 
Lord we cry out to You come quickly 
We long for the day
When we will see Your face 
We long to be with You come quickly 

And breathe on us until You come 
Breathe on us until You come

When sorrow like sea billows roll
Whatever my lot Thou hast taught me to say 
It is well, it is well with my soul

It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

Though Satan should buffet 
If trials should come 
Let this blest assurance control 
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate
And hath shed His own blood for my soul 

It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

My sin - oh the bliss of this glorious thought 
My sin not in part but in whole 
Is nailed to His cross and I bear it no more 
Praise the Lord 
Praise the Lord O my soul 

It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

For me be it Christ be it Christ hence to live 
If Jordan above me shall roll 
No pang shall be mine for in death as in life 
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul 

It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

But Lord, tis for Thee
For Thy coming we wait 
The sky not the grave is our goal
Oh trump of the angel oh voice of the Lord
Blessed hope blessed rest of my soul 

It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

On which the Prince of Glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss 
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it Lord that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my Lord:
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet ,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were an offering far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

Men of earth give praises due;
For He is the well beloved, 
Since He rent the veil in two.

Lo! He is the mighty conq'ror,

Into our hands He will give the ground we claim.

God is at work in us His purpose to perform,
Building a Kingdom of power not of words.

Let's give the glory to Him now

Rejoice, rejoice, Christ is in you

We're made of clay but this treasure is within.

Love's own feast is spread

Seeking lives to win
Who such love can fathom 
From God's heart which flows
Or such grace e'er measure
Which His hand bestows

Pressing onward upward
Life grows pure and strong
Tis the vision splendid 
Saves from all that's wrong

Fairer than morning
Lovelier than daylight

Amid the mystic shadows
The solemn hush of nature newly born
Alone with Thee in breathless adoration
In the calm dew and freshness of the morn

As in the dawning o'er the waveless ocean
The image of the morning star doth rest
So in the stillness Thou beholdest only
Thine image in the waters of my breast

Still, still with Thee
As to each newborn morning
A fresh and solemn splendour still is given
So does this blessed consciousness awaking
Breathe each day nearness
Unto Thee and heaven.

When sinks the soul 
Subdued by toil to slumber
Its closing eye looks up to Thee in prayer
Sweet the repose beneath thy wings o'er shading
But sweeter still to wake and find Thee there

So shall it be at last
In that bright morning
When the soul waketh 
And life's shadows fleeO in that hour 
Fairer than daylight dawning
Shall rise the glorious thought
I am with Thee

The dawn of heaven breaks;
The summer morn I've sighed for
The fair, sweet morn awakes:
Dark, dark hath been the midnight
But dayspring is at hand,
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

O Christ, He is the fountain
The deep, sweet well of love!
The streams on earth I've tasted
More deep I'll drink above:
There to an ocean fullness
His mercy doth expand,
And glory, glory dwelleth 
In Immanuel's land.

With mercy and with judgment 
My web of time He wove,
And aye, the dews of sorrow 
Were lustered by His love;
I'll bless the hand that guided
I'll bless the heart that planned
When throned where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

O I am my Beloved's 
And my Beloved is mine!
He brings a poor vile sinner 
Into His "house of wine".
I stand upon His merit
I know no other stand,
Not even where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

The Bride eyes not her garment
But her dear Bridegroom's face;
I will not gaze at glory
But on my King of grace.
Not at the crown He giveth
But on His pierced hand;
The Lamb is all the glory
Of Immanuel's land

I've wrestled on towards Heaven
Against storm and wind and tide,
Now, like a weary traveller
That leaneth on his guide,
Amid the shades of evening
While sinks life's lingering sand,
I hail the glory dawning
From Immanuel's land.

Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save
Till on the cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath

You are the Lord of Hosts, God Almighty
I will follow You El-Shaddai

I will do Your will, do it wholeheartedly
I will give my life, give it unreservedly
To live all my life for One who's faithful
My lips filled with Your praise because I'm grateful.

El-Shaddai, El-Shaddai, 
You're the God of my supply
You are the Lord of Hosts, God Almighty
I will follow You El-Shaddai

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">When the trump of the great archangel
It's mighty tones shall sound
And the end of the world proclaiming
Shall pierce the depth profound
When the Son of man shall come in His glory
With all the saints on high
What a shouting in the skies
From the multitudes that rise
Changed in the twinkling of an eye

Changed in the twinkling of an eye
Changed in the twinkling of an eye
The trumpet shall sound
The dead shall be raised
Changed in the twinkling of an eye

When He comes in the clouds decending
And they who loved Him here
From their graves shall awake and praise Him
With joy and not with fear
When the body and the soul are united
And clothed no more to die
What a shouting there will be
When each others face we see
Changed in the twinkling of an eye

Changed in the twinkling of an eye
Changed in the twinkling of an eye
The trumpet shall sound
The dead shall be raised
Changed in the twinkling of an eye

O the seed that was sown in weakness
Shall then be raised in power
And the songs of the blood-bought millions
Shall hail that blissful hour
When we gather safely home in the morning
And night's dark shadows fly
What a shouting on the shore
When we meet to part no more
Changed in the twinkling of an eye

Changed in the twinkling of an eye
Changed in the twinkling of an eye
The trumpet shall sound
The dead shall be raised
Changed in the twinkling of an eye

Like the sound of many waters 
It's the sound of worship 
Coming from the throne 
There are cries of adoration 
As men from every nation 
Lift their voice to make
His glory known, singing 

Holy holy holy are You Lord 
Holy holy holy are You Lord 
The elders and angels bow 
The redeemed worship You now 
Holy holy holy are You Lord

Pilgrim through this barren land
I am weak, but Thou art mighty
Hold me with Thy powerful hand
Bread of heaven
Bread of heaven
Feed me now and evermore

Open now the crystal fountain
Whence the healing stream doth flow
Let the fiery cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through
Strong Deliverer
Strong Deliverer
Be Thou still my strength and shield

If I tread the verge of Jordan
Bid my anxious fears subside
Bear me through the swelling torrent
Land me safe on Canaan's side
Songs of praises 
Songs of praises 
I will ever give to Thee                                                                                                                                                       

Saviour, come we long to see Thee
Long to dwell with Thee above
And to know in full communion
All the sweetness of Thy love

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">In the darkness 
Where everything is unknown 
I faced the power of sin on my own 
I did not know of a place 
Where I could go 
Where I could find a way 
To heal my wounded soul 

He said that I could come 
Into His presence without fear 
Into the Holy place 
Where His mercy hovers near 
I'm running I'm running 
I'm running to the mercy seat 
Where Jesus is calling 
He said His grace would cover me 
His blood will flow freely 
It will provide the healing 
I'm running to the mercy seat 
I'm running to the mercy seat

Are you living where hope has not been 
Lost in the curse of a life time of sin 
Lovely illusions they never come true 
I know where there's a place 
Of mercy for you 

He said that you could come 
Into His presence without fear 
Into the Holy place 
Where His mercy hovers near 
Come running come running 
Come running to the mercy seat 
Where Jesus is calling 
His grace will be a covering 
His blood will flow freely 
It will provide the healing 
Come running to the mercy seat 
Come running to the mercy seat
