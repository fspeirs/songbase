Who died and rose on high 
Who died eternal life to bring 
And lives that death may die

Behold His hands and side 
Those wounds yet visible above 
In beauty glorified 
No angel in the sky 
Can fully bear that sight 
But downward bends His burning eye
At mysteries so bright

Crown Him the Lord of peace
Whose power a sceptre sways 
From pole to pole that wars may cease
And all be prayer and praise 
His reign shall know no end 
And round His pierced feet 
Fair flowers of paradise extend 
Their fragrance ever sweet

My great Redeemer's praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace!

My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honours of Thy name.

Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease;
'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
'Tis life, and health, and peace.

He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean,
His blood availed for me.

Hear Him, ye deaf;
His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Saviour come,
And leap, ye lame, for joy.</attribute>

Rolls its waters at my feet;

Where the loved ones I shall meet.

The beauty of the Lord
You mean more to me
Than any earthly thing

Delivered from the wicked's might

To bring the light and glory in

Send the fire today 
For strength to always do what's right
For grace to conquer in the fight 
For power to walk the world in white

To live a dying world to save 
Send the fire today

We give our lives to you today 
So crown the offering now we pray 
Send the fire today x 3

The dawn of heaven breaks;
The summer morn I've sighed for
The fair, sweet morn awakes:
Dark, dark hath been the midnight
But dayspring is at hand,
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

O Christ, He is the fountain
The deep, sweet well of love!
The streams on earth I've tasted
More deep I'll drink above:
There to an ocean fullness
His mercy doth expand,
And glory, glory dwelleth 
In Immanuel's land.

With mercy and with judgment 
My web of time He wove,
And aye, the dews of sorrow 
Were lustered by His love;
I'll bless the hand that guided
I'll bless the heart that planned
When throned where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

O I am my Beloved's 
And my Beloved is mine!
He brings a poor vile sinner 
Into His "house of wine".
I stand upon His merit
I know no other stand,
Not even where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

The Bride eyes not her garment
But her dear Bridegroom's face;
I will not gaze at glory
But on my King of grace.
Not at the crown He giveth
But on His pierced hand;
The Lamb is all the glory
Of Immanuel's land

I've wrestled on towards Heaven
Against storm and wind and tide,
Now, like a weary traveller
That leaneth on his guide,
Amid the shades of evening
While sinks life's lingering sand,
I hail the glory dawning
From Immanuel's land.

From their graves shall awake and praise Him
With joy and not with fear
When the body and the soul are united
And clothed no more to die
What a shouting there will be
When each others face we see
Changed in the twinkling of an eye

Changed in the twinkling of an eye
Changed in the twinkling of an eye
The trumpet shall sound
The dead shall be raised
Changed in the twinkling of an eye

O the seed that was sown in weakness
Shall then be raised in power
And the songs of the blood-bought millions
Shall hail that blissful hour
When we gather safely home in the morning
And night's dark shadows fly
What a shouting on the shore
When we meet to part no more
Changed in the twinkling of an eye

Changed in the twinkling of an eye
Changed in the twinkling of an eye
The trumpet shall sound
The dead shall be raised
Changed in the twinkling of an eye

Like the sound of many waters 
It's the sound of worship 
Coming from the throne

As men from every nation

His glory known, singing 

Holy holy holy are You Lord

The elders and angels bow

Pilgrim through this barren land
I am weak, but Thou art mighty
Hold me with Thy powerful hand
Bread of heaven

Feed me now and evermore

Open now the crystal fountain
Whence the healing stream doth flow
Let the fiery cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through
Strong Deliverer

Be Thou still my strength and shield

If I tread the verge of Jordan
Bid my anxious fears subside
Bear me through the swelling torrent
Land me safe on Canaan's side

If I could tell I'd light loves holy flame

His word went through my heart and how it shamed me
Because He loved much more than I had known

If you could hear Him speak

He loves you you're his chosen diadem
You're the joy that He had set before Him
As on a lonely cross He spoke your name

I wish that I could say your name as He did
Because if you could hear it even once
Then all your love would wake and rush to meet Him

How long, before we see Your righteous hand?
How long, before Your name is lifted high?
How long, before the weeping turns to songs of joy?

Lord we know Your heart is broken
By the evil that You see
And you've stayed Your hand of judgement
For You plan to set men free.
But the land is still in darkness
And we've fled from what is right
We have failed the silent children
Who will never see the light.

How long, before You drench the barren land?
How long, before we see Your righteous hand?
How long, before Your name is lifted high?
How long, before the weeping turns to songs of joy?

But I know a day is coming
When the deaf will hear His voice
When the blind will see their Saviour
And the lame will leap for joy.
When the widow finds a Husband
Who will always love His bride
And the orphan finds a Father
Who will never leave her side. 

How long, before Your glory lights the skies?
How long, before Your radiance lifts our eyes?
How long, before Your fragrance fills the air?
How long, before the earth resounds with songs of joy?

Should set His love upon the sons of men 
Or why as Shepherd He should seek the wanderers
To bring them back they know not how or when 
But this I know that He was born of Mary 
When Bethlehem's manger was His only home 
And that He lived at nazareth and laboured 
And so the Saviour, 
Saviour of the world is come 

I cannot tell how silently He suffered 
As with His peace he graced this place of tears 
Or how His heart upon the cross was broken 
The crown of pain to three and thirty years 
But this I know He heals the broken-hearted 
And stays our sin and calms our lurking fear 
And lifts the burden from the heavy-laden 
For yet the Saviour Saviour of the world is here 

I cannot tell how He will win the nations 
How He will claim His earthly heritage 
How satisfy the needs and aspirations 
Of east and west of sinner and of sage 
But this I know all flesh shall see His glory 
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown 
And some glad day 
His sun shall shine in splendour 
When He the Saviour,
Saviour of the world is known 

I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship 
When at his bidding every storm is stilled 
Or who can say how great the jubilation 
When all the hearts of men with love are filled 
But this I know the skies will thrill with rapture 
And myriad myriad human voices sing 
And earth to heaven 
And heaven to earth will answer

Saviour of the world is King!" </attribute>

The soul finds happiness in none;

I have heard My people cry 
All who dwell in dark and sin
My hand will save 
I who made the stars of night
I will make their darkness bright 
I will speak My word to them 
Whom shall I send 

Here I am Lord is it I Lord 
I have heard You calling in the night 
I will go Lord if You lead me 
I will hold Your people in my heart 

I the Lord of snow and rain 
I have borne my people's pain 
I have wept for love of them 
They turn away 
I will break their hearts of stone 
Give them hearts for love alone 
I will speak My word to them 
Whom shall I send

Here I am Lord is it I Lord 
I have heard You calling in the night 
I will go Lord if You lead me 
I will hold Your people in my heart 

I the Lord of wind and flame 
I will tend the poor and lame 
I will set a feast for them
My hand will save 
Finest bread I will provide
Till their hearts are satisfied 
I will give My life to them
Whom shall I send

Here I am Lord is it I Lord 
I have heard You calling in the night 
I will go Lord if You lead me 
I will hold Your people in my heart

An interest in the Saviour's blood? 
Died He for me who caused His pain? 
For me who Him to death pursued? 
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou my God shouldst die for me?

Tis Mystery all! The Immortal dies
Who can explore His strange design? 
In vain the first-born seraph tries
To sound the depths of love divine! 
Tis mercy all! Let earth adore
Let angel minds inquire no more 

He left His Father's throne above 
So free so infinite His grace! 
Emptied Himself of all but love
And bled for Adam's helpless race 
Tis mercy all, immense and free
For O my God it found out me! 

Long my imprisoned spirit lay 
Fast bound in sin and nature's night 
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray 
I woke the dungeon flamed with light 
My chains fell off my heart was free
I rose went forth and followed Thee 

No condemnation now I dread 
Jesus and all in Him is mine 
Alive in Him my living head
And clothed in righteousness divine 
Bold I approach the eternal throne
And claim the crown through

Face to face what will it be
When with rapture I behold Him
Jesus Christ Who died for me

Face to face shall I behold Him
Far beyond the starry sky
Face to face in all His glory
I shall see Him by and by

Only faintly now I see Him
With the darkling veil between
But a blessed day is coming
When His glory shall be seen

Face to face shall I behold Him
Far beyond the starry sky
Face to face in all His glory
I shall see Him by and by

What rejoicing in His presence
When are banished grief and pain
When the crooked ways are straightened
And the dark things shall be plain

Face to face shall I behold Him
Far beyond the starry sky
Face to face in all His glory
I shall see Him by and by

Face to face!
O blissful moment
Face to face–
To see and know
Face to face with my Redeemer
Jesus Christ who loves me so

The rivers of grief shall not thee overflow;

How vast beyond all measure 
That He should give His only son 
To make a wretch His treasure 
How great the pain of searing loss 
The Father turns His face away 
As wounds which mar the Chosen One 
Bring many sons to glory 

Behold the man upon a cross 
My sin upon His shoulders 
Ashamed I hear my mocking voice 
Call out among the scoffers 
It was my sin that held Him there 
Until it was accomplished 
His dying breath has brought me life 
I know that it is finished

I will not boast in anything 
No gifts no power no wisdom 
But I will boast in Jesus Christ 
His death and resurrection 
Why should I gain from His reward 
I cannot give an answer 
But this I know with all my heart 
His wounds have paid my ransom </attribute>

He is my light my strength my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled when strivings cease
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save
Till on the cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I stand.</attribute>

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">There’s a road that is open before us 
And it leads to a world unknown; 
Oft have we pondered its pleasures 
And pictured the heavenly throne. 

We have thought of myriad angels, 
Of harps and of jubilant song; 
We have pictured our Lord and our Saviour 
Where they praise Him all the day long. 

But now our heavenly Guide
Is taking us upward from earth, 
And we’re entering spiritual hallways 
With the sense of a spiritual birth. 

There’s a sensing of realms that we know not 
An acute awareness of need, 
To learn of the things of the Spirit, 
To sit at God’s table and feed. 

The Lamb whom we pictured we see not 
With the eyes of our flesh or our mind, 
But we sense His ineffable nearness 
As He opens the eyes of the blind. 

Instruct us, our God and our Father, 
As we move in this heavenly place;
Teach us the laws of the kingdom 
As we bathe in Thy glory and grace. 

Set our minds firmly on Jesus 
As we search for that radiant face; 
Let our feet go fervently forward 
As we seek for that uttermost place. 

Chorus
Sing we now the song of Jesus, 
Let the vaults of heaven ring, 
Let all nations come and worship 
At the throne of heaven’s king. 

Seek we now the joy of Jesus, 
Seek the deepest wells of life; 
Let us rise and take the kingdom, 
Rise victorious in the strife.</attribute>

He came to love heal and forgive 
He lived and died to buy my pardon 
An empty grave is there 
To prove my Saviour lives 

Because He lives I can face tomorrow 
Because He lives all fear is gone 
Because I know I know
He holds the future 
And life is worth the living 
Just because He lives 

And then one day I'll cross the river 
I'll fight life's final war with pain 
And then as death gives way to vict'ry 
I'll see the lights of glory and
I'll know He lives

Because He lives I can face tomorrow 
Because He lives all fear is gone

And myrrh their texture fills

Out of the ivory palaces
Into a world of woe
Only His great eternal love
Made my Saviour go

His life had also its sorrow sore
For aloes had a part
And when I think of the cross He bore
My eyes with tear drops start

Out of the ivory palaces
Into a world of woe
Only His great eternal love
Made my Saviour go

His garments too were in cassia dipped
With healing in a touch
Each time my feet in some sin have slipped
He took me from its clutch

Out of the ivory palaces
Into a world of woe
Only His great eternal love
Made my Saviour go

In garments glorious He will come 
To open wide the door
And I shall enter my heavn'ly home
To dwell for ever more

The Giver of life was He.
Yet my Lord was despised 
And rejected of men,
This Jesus of Calvary.

He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

Price for healing was paid, 
As those cruel stripes were made,
Within Pilate's judgment hall.
Now His suffering affords perfect healing for all. 
This wonderful Healer's mine.

He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

Came the leper to Christ, 
Saying, "Surely I know
That Thou, Lord, canst make me whole."
When his great faith was seen, Jesus said, "Yes, I will,"
And touched him and made him clean.

He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

He has healed my sick soul, made me every whit whole,
And He'll do the same for you.
He's the same yesterday and today and for aye,
This Healer of men today.

He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

And walks on the wings of the wind.
He sends forth the springs from the valleys
They flow between mountains
The birds of the air, dwell by the waters
Lifting their voices in song. 

Singing glory, glory, glory to the Lamb
All praises and honour, forever

He made the moon for it's seasons
The sun knows its settings
He looks at the earth and it trembles,
He touches the mountains and they smoke
I will sing to the Lord all my life
I will sing praises to my God
As long as I live
Praises to the Lord, O my soul. 

Singing glory, glory, glory to the Lamb
All praises and honour, forever

Singing glory, hallelujah, glory to our God
All praises and honour, forever. </attribute>

With a holy nation sounding out the story. 

There’ll be dancing, dancing, dancing there before the throne
As a joyous people worship God alone. 

Laughing, weeping, singing, dancing. 
See the hosts of God advancing, 
See the powers of darkness yield 
As Judah’s lion takes the field 
As Judah’s lion takes the field. 

Laughing, weeping, dancing, singing, 
Hear the courts of heaven ringing; 
This the long-awaited hour, 
This the day of heaven’s power 
This is the day of heaven’s power. 

Rivers rising, strong tides swelling, 
Feel the waters fast upwelling; 
This the coming glorious flood, 
A church triumphant through the blood 
A church triumphant through the blood.</attribute>

When the bird waketh

Fairer than morning
Lovelier than daylight

I am with Thee

Amid the mystic shadows
The solemn hush of nature newly born
Alone with Thee in breathless adoration
In the calm dew and freshness of the morn

As in the dawning o'er the waveless ocean
The image of the morning star doth rest
So in the stillness Thou beholdest only
Thine image in the waters of my breast

Still, still with Thee
As to each newborn morning
A fresh and solemn splendour still is given
So does this blessed consciousness awaking
Breathe each day nearness
Unto Thee and heaven.

When sinks the soul 
Subdued by toil to slumber
Its closing eye looks up to Thee in prayer
Sweet the repose beneath thy wings o'er shading
But sweeter still to wake and find Thee there

So shall it be at last
In that bright morning
When the soul waketh 
And life's shadows flee
O in that hour 
Fairer than daylight dawning
Shall rise the glorious thought
I am with Thee

It seemed that everything had changed
The only certain thing 
Was the child that moved within
On the road that would not end
Winding down to Bethlehem
So far away from home

Just a blanket on the floor
Of that vacant cattle stall
But there the child was born
She held Him in her arms
And as she laid Him down to sleep
She wondered will it always be
So bitter yet so sweet

And did she see there
In the straw by His head a thorn
And did she smell myrrh
In the air on that starry night
And did she hear angels sing
Not so far away
Till at last the sun rose blood red
In the morning sky

And as she watched Him through the years
Her joy was mingled with her tears
And she’d feel it all again 
The glory and the pain
And when the miracles began
She wondered Who is this Man
And where will this all end
Then the words of ancient seers 
Echoed down the centuries
A virgin shall conceive
God with us, Prince of Peace
Man of sorrow strangest name
She wondered time and time again
So bitter yet so sweet

And did she see there
In the straw by His head a thorn
And did she smell myrrh
In the air on that starry night
And did she hear angels sing
Not so far away
Till at last the sun rose blood red
In the morning sky

 ‘Till against a darkened sky 
The Son she loved was lifted high 
And with His dying breath 
She heard Him say “Father forgive”
And to the criminal beside 
“Today with me in Paradise”

A quiet calm a holy hush 
To fall on that lonely hill 

Breaking heaven's glory
Calling into the night 
Softly shining of starlight
Holy glory of light 

An angel voice a holy light
A song of peace on earth 
The Son has come the joyful news 
To us is born the King 

Singing songs of heaven
Shouting "Glory to God"
Dancing heaven rejoicing
Creation welcomes the Son

Glory hallelujah 
Glory Glory to God 
Glory in the highest 
Glory Glory to God

Born for us on earth below
See the Lamb of God appears 
Promised from eternal years 

Hail thou ever-blessed morn 
Hail redemption’s happy dawn 
Sing through all Jerusalem 
Christ is born in Bethlehem 

Lo within a manger lies 
He who built the starry skies 
He who throned in height sublime 
Sits amid the cherubim 

Hail thou ever-blessed morn 
Hail redemption’s happy dawn 
Sing through all Jerusalem 
Christ is born in Bethlehem 

Say ye holy shepherds say 
What your joyful news to-day 
Wherefore have ye left your sheep 
On the lonely mountain steep 

Hail thou ever-blessed morn 
Hail redemption’s happy dawn 
Sing through all Jerusalem 
Christ is born in Bethlehem 
 
As we watched at dead of night 
Lo we saw a wondrous light 
Angels singing peace on earth 
Told us of the Saviour’s birth 

Hail thou ever-blessed morn 
Hail redemption’s happy dawn 
Sing through all Jerusalem 
Christ is born in Bethlehem 

Sacred Infant all divine 
What a tender love was Thine 
Thus to come from highest bliss 
Down to such a world as this 

Hail thou ever-blessed morn 
Hail redemption’s happy dawn 
Sing through all Jerusalem 
Christ is born in Bethlehem 

Teach oh teach us holy child 
By Thy face so meek and mild 
Teach us to resemble Thee 
In Thy sweet humility 

Hail thou ever-blessed morn 
Hail redemption’s happy dawn 
Sing through all Jerusalem 
Christ is born in Bethlehem

Long lay the world in sin and darkness pining
Till He appeared gift of infinite worth 
Behold the babe in yonder manger lowly 
'Tis God's own Son come down in human form
Fall on your knees behold the Lord most Holy

O night divine O night O night divine 

With humble hearts we bow in adoration 
Before this Child gift of God's matchless love 
Sent from on high to purchase our salvation 
That we might dwell with Him ever above 
What grace untold to leave the bliss of glory 
And die for sinners guilty and forlorn 
Fall on your knees repeat the wondrous story 

O night divine O night when Christ was born
O night divine O night O night divine 

O day of Joy when in eternal splendour 
He shall return in His glory to reign 
When every tongue due praise to Him shall render 
His power and might to all nations proclaim 
A thrill of hope the longing heart rejoices 
For soon shall dawn that glad eternal morn 
Fall on your knees with joy lift up your voices

The silent stars go by

The everlasting light 
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight 

O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth

While mortals sleep the angels keep 
Their watch of wondering love 

How silently how silently
The wondrous gift is given 
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven 
No ear may hear His coming 
But in this world of sin 
Where meek souls will receive Him 
Still the dear Christ enters in

Descend to us we pray 
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today

Washed all my sins away.

From sin to set me free 
From sin to set me free 
From sin to set me free 
That on the cross He shed His blood 
From sin to set me free 

Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power
Till all the ransomed church of God 
Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Till all the ransomed church of God 
Be saved, to sin no more.

E’er since, by faith, I saw the stream 
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme

Or on the tide be borne away 

To live to love we set our goals 
Never to be chained 
But be blown by winds of fancy 
Freedom is our promise 
And we hold it in our hand 
But we're building on the sand 

For time and tide wait for no man

Fading into misted memory 
While Jesus stands and whispers 
Follow me, follow me

Lost in the curse of a lifetime of sin 
Lovely illusions they never come true 
I know where there's a place 
Of mercy for you 

He said that you could come 
Into His presence without fear 
Into the Holy place 
Where His mercy hovers near 
Come running, come running 
Come running to the mercy seat 
Where Jesus is calling 
His grace will be a covering 
His blood will flow freely 
It will provide the healing 
Come running to the mercy seat 
Come running to the mercy seat

Transformed Thy love to know

And almost would prevail
In that dark hour be Thou

Lend then Thy strong embrace
Uphold me by Thy grace
In weakness be my strength

In an upper room 
Waiting for God's power from on high 
They were waiting for a promise
Made not so long before 
Jesus said He'd come  
And set their souls on fire 
Suddenly the sound of wind came rushing in 
And their hearts were set aflame 
And to them He gave the power
When they called upon His name 

Suddenly, I can feel His mighty power 
Suddenly, I can feel a change within 
And I know that I will never 
Never be the same again 
You can find all you need at the altar 
Leave behind every weight that presses in 
For the Spirit of the Lord is still moving suddenly 

Never let your heart be troubled
No need to be afraid 
When you feel you don't have
Strength to carry on 
There is glory in His presence
There is healing in His love 
He's our anchor and our peace in every storm 
So my friend call on the Lord 
And trust His word 
From age to age He's still the same 
For He's a God who loves us
A God who hears us 
There's power in His name 

Suddenly, I can feel His mighty power 
Suddenly, I can feel a change within 
And I know that I will never 
Never be the same again 
You can find all you need at the altar

On which the Prince of Glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss 
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it Lord that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my Lord:
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet ,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were an offering far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

The deaf shall have hearing 
The blind folk shall see 
The lame shall be loosed from their infirmity 
The crooked made straight 
And the broken made whole 
This latter time blessing as promised by Joel 

O river of God flow down on me 
O river of God flow out from me 
O river of God so full and free 
O river of God I cry to thee

The fetters of fear and of doubt soon shall break 
When unbelief goes and the church shall awake 
The chains of hard bondage forever will fall 
And Jesus exalted supreme over all 

O river of God flow down on me 
O river of God flow out from me 
O river of God so full and free 
O river of God I cry to thee

By this flowing river earth's bondage shall cease 
The floods are now rising to bring us release 
The vision is glorious then why not believe
Step into the blessing His fullness receive

You gently call me into Your presence
Guiding me by Your Holy Spirit
Teach me dear Lord       
To live all of my life through Your eyes

I'm captured by Your holy calling
Set me apart I know You're drawing me to Yourself
Lead me Lord I pray

Take me, mould me, use me, fill me
I give my life to the Potter's hand
Call me, guide me, lead me, walk beside me
I give my life, to the Potter's hand

A day I will never forget
After I wandered in darkness away
Jesus my saviour I met
O, what a tender compassionate Friend
He met the need of my heart
Shadows dispelling with joy I am telling
He made all the darkness depart

Heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul
When at the cross
My saviour made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
When heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul

Born of the Spirit with life from above
Into God's family divine
Justified fully thro' Calvary's love
O what a standing is mine
And the transaction so quickly was made
When as a sinner I came
Took of the offer of grace He did proffer
He saved me O praise His dear name

Heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul
When at the cross
My saviour made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
When heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul

Now I've a hope that will surely endure
After the passing of time
I have a future in heaven for sure
There in those mansions sublime
And it's because of that wonderful day
When at the cross I believed
Riches eternal and blessings supernal
From His precious hand I received

Heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul
When at the cross
My saviour made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
When heaven came down

So they knew from the start
This road would not lead to fame
All they really knew for sure was Jesus had called to them
He said "Come follow me" and they came
With reckless abandon they came

Empty nets lying there at the waters edge
Told a story that few could believe and none could explain
How some crazy fishermen agreed to go where Jesus lead
With no thought for what they would gain
For Jesus had called them by name and they answered

[Chorus:]
We will abandon it all for the sake of the call
No other reason at all but the sake of the call
Wholly devoted to live and to die
For the sake of the call

Drawn like the rivers are drawn to the sea
No turning back for the water cannot help but flow
Once we hear the Savior's call we'll follow wherever he leads
Because of the love He has shown
And because he has called us to go we will answer

We will abandon it all for the sake of the call
No other reason at all but the sake of the call
Wholly devoted to live and to die

[Bridge:]
Not for the sake of a creed or a cause
Not for a dream or a promise
Simply because it is Jesus who calls
And if we believe we'll obey

We will abandon it all for the sake of the call

Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve 
Because Thy promise I believe

Has broken every barrier down 
Now to be Thine, yea Thine alone,

Turning night to glorious day 
Let the song grow louder 
As our love grows stronger
Let it shine, let it shine 

We'll walk for truth speak out for love 
In Jesus name we shall be strong 
To lift the fallen to save the children 
To fill the nation with Your song

Turning night to glorious day

Men of earth give praises due;
For He is the well beloved,

For the gift of Jesus our Lord
Belief in Him gives us life eternal
We are one in His family

Praise the Lord, let the earth rejoice
Praise the Lord all ye lands
Praise the Lord, let the earth rejoice
Praise the Lord all ye lands</attribute>

Sound the trumpet
Heavens gates are open wide
He is coming He is returning
Glory to the Lamb who died

On a day like today
Heaven and earth will pass away
In a moment suddenly
Comes the sound of jubilee

Sound the trumpet
Sound the trumpet
Heavens gates are open wide
He is coming He is returning
Glory to the Lamb who died

Conscious now of earthly things
Till we see the King of Kings
Such a long time so it seemed
Now hear the song of the redeemed

Sound the trumpet
Sound the trumpet
Heavens gates are open wide
He is coming He is returning
Glory to the Lamb who died

In this day in which we stand
We cry out from every land
Songs of triumph
Songs of love
One day we will sing above

Sound the trumpet
Sound the trumpet
Heavens gates are open wide
He is coming He is returning
Glory to the Lamb who died

Thank you for this day of grace
Till we see you face to face
Hasten Lord the wedding day
When we meet You in the way

Sound the trumpet
Sound the trumpet
Heavens gates are open wide
He is coming He is returning
Glory to the Lamb who died</attribute>

We are born as living stones 
Where You're enthroned 
And as You rose from death in power 
So rise within our worship 
Rise upon our praise 
Let the hand that saw You raised 
Clothe us in Your glory 
Draw us by Your grace 

O the glory of Your presence 
We Your temple 
Give You reverence 
So arise to Your rest 
And be blessed by our praise 
As we glory in Your embrace 
As Your presence now fills this place </attribute>

See the Man of sorrows now
From the fight returned victorious
Every knee to Him shall bow
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crowns become the Victor's brow.

Crown the Saviour, angels crown Him
Rich the trophies Jesus brings
In the seat of power enthrone Him
While the vault of heaven rings
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crown the Saviour, King of kings!

Sinners in derision crowned Him
Mocking thus the Saviour's claim
Saints and angels throng around Him
Own His title, praise His name
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Spread abroad the Victor's fame.

Hark those burst of acclamation
Hark those loud triumphant chords 
Jesus takes the highest station
O what joy the sight affords
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crown Him! Crown Him!

You alone are my strength, my shield
To You alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my hearts desire

You're my friend and You are my brother

So much more than anything

Calvary, Calvary
Burdens are lifted at Calvary
Jesus is very near

Days are filled with sorrow and care
Hearts are lonely and drear
Burdens are lifted at calvary
Jesus is very near

Burdens are lifted at Calvary
Jesus is very near

Cast your care on Jesus today
Leave your worry and fear
Burdens are lifted at Calvary
Jesus is very near

Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Calvary, Calvary
Burdens are lifted at Calvary
Jesus is very near

Troubled soul the Saviour can see
Every heart ache and tear
Burdens are lifted at calvary
Jesus is very near

Burdens are lifted at Calvary,

Saviour Divine
For thou art all to me 
And I am Thine
Is there on earth a closer bond than this
That my beloved's mine and I am His

Thine am I by all ties
But chiefly Thine 
That through they sacrifice
Thou Lord art mine
By Thine own chords of love so sweetly wound
Around me I to Thee am closely bound

To Thee, Thou dying Lamb 
I all things owe
All that I have and am
And all I know
All that I have is now no longer mine
And I am not my own, Lord I am Thine

How can I Lord withhold
Life's brightest hour
From Thee or gathered gold
Or any power?
Why should I keep one precious thing from Thee
When Thou hast given Thine own dear self for me

I pray Thee Saviour keep
Me in thy love
Until deaths holy sleep
Shall me remove
To that fair realm where, sin and sorrow o'er
Thou and Thine own are one for evermore
