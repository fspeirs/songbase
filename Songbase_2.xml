Salvation eternal light

Depart in peace, depart in peace

Let Thy servant Lord depart in peace

Coming closer through the night 
We behold the dawn of His returning 
O golden morn eternal light
 
Now let Thy people Lord 
Depart in peace, depart in peace

Let Thy people Lord depart in peace 
Let Thy people Lord depart in peace

Delivered from the wicked's might

Neither shall the plague come nigh 
For He shall place His angels o'er you 
To keep you safe in all your ways

The dawn of heaven breaks;
The summer morn I've sighed for
The fair, sweet morn awakes:
Dark, dark hath been the midnight
But dayspring is at hand,
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

O Christ, He is the fountain
The deep, sweet well of love!
The streams on earth I've tasted
More deep I'll drink above:
There to an ocean fullness
His mercy doth expand,
And glory, glory dwelleth 
In Immanuel's land.

With mercy and with judgment 
My web of time He wove,
And aye, the dews of sorrow 
Were lustered by His love;
I'll bless the hand that guided
I'll bless the heart that planned
When throned where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

O I am my Beloved's 
And my Beloved is mine!
He brings a poor vile sinner 
Into His "house of wine".
I stand upon His merit
I know no other stand,
Not even where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

The Bride eyes not her garment
But her dear Bridegroom's face;
I will not gaze at glory
But on my King of grace.
Not at the crown He giveth
But on His pierced hand;
The Lamb is all the glory
Of Immanuel's land

I've wrestled on towards Heaven
Against storm and wind and tide,
Now, like a weary traveller
That leaneth on his guide,
Amid the shades of evening
While sinks life's lingering sand,
I hail the glory dawning
From Immanuel's land.

O if you could hear that voice
If you could hear Him speak
Just once your name, your name

If I could only tell you how He loves you
If I could only speak to you your name
As Jesus spoke your name to me this morning
If I could tell I'd light loves holy flame

Just once He spoke your name in His voice
He told me how he loves you, you're His own
His word went through my heart and how it shamed me
Because He loved much more than I had known

O if you could only hear
O if you could hear that voice
If you could hear Him speak
Just once your name, your name

He loves you more than finest gold or silver
He loves you you're his chosen diadem
You're the joy that He had set before Him
As on a lonely cross He spoke your name

I wish that I could say your name as He did
Because if you could hear it even once
Then all your love would wake and rush to meet Him
To join with God the Fathers and the Sons

O if you could only hear
O if you could hear that voice
If you could hear Him speak
Just once your name, your name

Should set His love upon the sons of men 
Or why as Shepherd He should seek the wanderers
To bring them back they know not how or when 
But this I know that He was born of Mary 
When Bethlehem's manger was His only home 
And that He lived at nazareth and laboured 
And so the Saviour, 
Saviour of the world is come 

I cannot tell how silently He suffered 
As with His peace he graced this place of tears 
Or how His heart upon the cross was broken 
The crown of pain to three and thirty years 
But this I know He heals the broken-hearted 
And stays our sin and calms our lurking fear 
And lifts the burden from the heavy-laden 
For yet the Saviour Saviour of the world is here 

I cannot tell how He will win the nations 
How He will claim His earthly heritage 
How satisfy the needs and aspirations 
Of east and west of sinner and of sage 
But this I know all flesh shall see His glory 
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown 
And some glad day 
His sun shall shine in splendour 
When He the Saviour,
Saviour of the world is known 

I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship 
When at his bidding every storm is stilled 
Or who can say how great the jubilation 
When all the hearts of men with love are filled 
But this I know the skies will thrill with rapture 
And myriad myriad human voices sing 
And earth to heaven 
And heaven to earth will answer 
"At last the Saviour, 
Saviour of the world is King!" </attribute>

To souls impressed with sacred love!
Where'er they dwell, they dwell in Thee;

While place we seek, or place we shun,
The soul finds happiness in none;
But, with my God to guide our way,
'Tis equal joy to go or stay.

That were indeed a dreadful lot;
But regions none remote I call,
Secure of finding God in all.</attribute>

How vast beyond all measure 
That He should give His only son 
To make a wretch His treasure 
How great the pain of searing loss

As wounds which mar the Chosen One 
Bring many sons to glory 

Behold the man upon a cross 
My sin upon His shoulders 
Ashamed I hear my mocking voice 
Call out among the scoffers 
It was my sin that held Him there 
Until it was accomplished 
His dying breath has brought me life 
I know that it is finished

I will not boast in anything 
No gifts no power no wisdom 
But I will boast in Jesus Christ

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">There’s a road that is open before us 
And it leads to a world unknown; 
Oft have we pondered its pleasures 
And pictured the heavenly throne. 

We have thought of myriad angels, 
Of harps and of jubilant song; 
We have pictured our Lord and our Saviour 
Where they praise Him all the day long. 

But now our heavenly Guide
Is taking us upward from earth, 
And we’re entering spiritual hallways 
With the sense of a spiritual birth. 

There’s a sensing of realms that we know not 
An acute awareness of need, 
To learn of the things of the Spirit, 
To sit at God’s table and feed. 

The Lamb whom we pictured we see not 
With the eyes of our flesh or our mind, 
But we sense His ineffable nearness 
As He opens the eyes of the blind. 

Instruct us, our God and our Father, 
As we move in this heavenly place;
Teach us the laws of the kingdom 
As we bathe in Thy glory and grace. 

Set our minds firmly on Jesus 
As we search for that radiant face; 
Let our feet go fervently forward 
As we seek for that uttermost place. 

Chorus
Sing we now the song of Jesus, 
Let the vaults of heaven ring, 
Let all nations come and worship 
At the throne of heaven’s king. 

Seek we now the joy of Jesus, 
Seek the deepest wells of life; 
Let us rise and take the kingdom, 
Rise victorious in the strife.</attribute>

The Giver of life was He.
Yet my Lord was despised

This Jesus of Calvary.

He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

Price for healing was paid, 
As those cruel stripes were made,
Within Pilate's judgment hall.
Now His suffering affords perfect healing for all. 
This wonderful Healer's mine.

He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

Came the leper to Christ, 
Saying, "Surely I know
That Thou, Lord, canst make me whole."
When his great faith was seen, Jesus said, "Yes, I will,"
And touched him and made him clean.

He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

He has healed my sick soul, made me every whit whole,
And He'll do the same for you.
He's the same yesterday and today and for aye,
This Healer of men today.

He was wounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities;
Surely He bore our sorrows,
And by His stripes we are healed.

Breathe each day nearness

Subdued by toil to slumber
Its closing eye looks up to Thee in prayer
Sweet the repose beneath thy wings o'er shading
But sweeter still to wake and find Thee there

So shall it be at last
In that bright morning
When the soul waketh 
And life's shadows flee
O in that hour 
Fairer than daylight dawning
Shall rise the glorious thought
I am with Thee

It seemed that everything had changed
The only certain thing 
Was the child that moved within
On the road that would not end
Winding down to Bethlehem
So far away from home

Just a blanket on the floor
Of that vacant cattle stall
But there the child was born
She held Him in her arms
And as she laid Him down to sleep
She wondered will it always be
So bitter yet so sweet

And did she see there
In the straw by His head a thorn
And did she smell myrrh
In the air on that starry night
And did she hear angels sing
Not so far away
Till at last the sun rose blood red
In the morning sky

And as she watched Him through the years
Her joy was mingled with her tears
And she’d feel it all again 
The glory and the pain
And when the miracles began
She wondered Who is this Man
And where will this all end
Then the words of ancient seers 
Echoed down the centuries
A virgin shall conceive
God with us, Prince of Peace
Man of sorrow strangest name
She wondered time and time again
So bitter yet so sweet

And did she see there
In the straw by His head a thorn
And did she smell myrrh
In the air on that starry night
And did she hear angels sing
Not so far away
Till at last the sun rose blood red
In the morning sky

 ‘Till against a darkened sky 
The Son she loved was lifted high 
And with His dying breath 
She heard Him say “Father forgive”
And to the criminal beside 
“Today with me in Paradise”

Are met in thee tonight

So God imparts to human hearts

Where meek souls will receive Him 
Still the dear Christ enters in

Descend to us we pray 
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today

A day I will never forget
After I wandered in darkness away
Jesus my saviour I met
O, what a tender compassionate Friend
He met the need of my heart
Shadows dispelling with joy I am telling
He made all the darkness depart

Heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul
When at the cross
My saviour made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
When heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul

Born of the Spirit with life from above
Into God's family divine
Justified fully thro' Calvary's love
O what a standing is mine
And the transaction so quickly was made
When as a sinner I came
Took of the offer of grace He did proffer
He saved me O praise His dear name

Heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul
When at the cross
My saviour made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
When heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul

Now I've a hope that will surely endure
After the passing of time
I have a future in heaven for sure
There in those mansions sublime
And it's because of that wonderful day
When at the cross I believed
Riches eternal and blessings supernal
From His precious hand I received

Heaven came down 
And glory filled my soul
When at the cross
My saviour made me whole
My sins were washed away
And my night was turned to day
When heaven came down

Of Jesus the Nazarene
And I wonder how He could love me
A sinner, condemned, unclean

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Saviour's love for me

For me it was in the garden
He prayed not My will, but Thine
He had no fears for His own griefs
But sweat drops of blood for mine

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Saviour's love for me

In pity angels beheld Him
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows 
He bore for my soul that night

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Saviour's love for me

He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own
He bore the burden to Calvary
And suffered and died alone

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Saviour's love for me

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see
'Twill be  my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me

How marvelous, how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful

For aloes had a part
And when I think of the cross He bore
My eyes with tear drops start

Out of the ivory palaces
Into a world of woe
Only His great eternal love
Made my Saviour go

His garments too were in cassia dipped
With healing in a touch
Each time my feet in some sin have slipped
He took me from its clutch

Out of the ivory palaces

Only His great eternal love
Made my Saviour go

In garments glorious He will come 
To open wide the door
And I shall enter my heavn'ly home
To dwell for ever more

Lord take up Your holy throne
Throughout all the earth
Take the place that is Yours alone
Throughout all the earth

And of the increase 
Of Your government 
There shall be no end
There shall be no end
There shall be no end
You are worthy Lord to reign

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
Tis grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will be shield and portion be
As long as life endures

Yes when this heart and flesh shall fail
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun</attribute>

Show us now the things of Jesus, 
Show us now His Blessed face.

Bless we now the name of Jesus, 
Thrill we now with holy power. 

Come, Holy Spirit, we can sense You: 
Coming like the gentle rain; 
Love a mantle falling on us
Sing we now our glad refrain. 

Take the things that shade His glory:
Pierce the clouds that lie between; 
Convict of sin, O Holy Spirit, 
That His glory may be seen. 

Come, Holy Spirit, to release us: 
Bind our wounds and set us free; 
Break the cruel bands of darkness, 
As thy glorious light we see. 

Lift the burdens, Holy Spirit: 
Heal the scars and staunch the pain, 
By the precious blood of Jesus,
Through the Lamb who once was slain.

Praise we now the stricken Lamb;
Unctioned by the Holy Spirit,

Healer of hearts binder of wounds 
Lives that are lost restored 
Flow through this land till every man 
Praises Your name once more 

Let Your word go forth 
Among the nations 
Let Your voice be heard 
Among the people 
May they know our God 
The only true God 
Reigns on earth 
As You reign in heaven 
May Your church be bold 
And speak with one voice 
May our hearts be strong 
And never failing 
May we know no fear 
Except a holy fear of You our King

Mould Thou this life into a vessel fair
Thyself to fill 
No charm with which to draw do I possess 
In Thee I find the secret of success 

O touch these yielded lips and through them pour 
Thy living thought 
I would not give to hungry souls the words
That man hath taught 
Shall they who seek for bread a stone receive?
It is God’s Word alone that can relieve

How wonderful a channel thus to be 
To those forlorn 
A messenger of peace and joy and hope 
To them that mourn 
O grant that I Thy risen life may share 
The virtue of Thy name to others bear 

Under th’anointing daily let me live 
A priest and king 
Relying not on fleshly energy 
Thy smile to win 
A simple soul in contact with my Lord 
In whom all fullness is forever stored 

O teach me Lord henceforth with Thee to walk 
In union deep 
Whilst tending other souls not to neglect 
My own to keep 
A separated soul unto the One 
Whose grace and love for me so much have done.

Tis Mystery all! The Immortal dies

To sound the depths of love divine! 
Tis mercy all! Let earth adore
Let angel minds inquire no more 

He left His Father's throne above 
So free so infinite His grace! 
Emptied Himself of all but love
And bled for Adam's helpless race 
Tis mercy all, immense and free
For O my God it found out me! 

Long my imprisoned spirit lay 
Fast bound in sin and nature's night 
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray 
I woke the dungeon flamed with light 
My chains fell off my heart was free
I rose went forth and followed Thee 

No condemnation now I dread

And clothed in righteousness divine

And cry aloud, and give to God 
The praise of our salvation. 

The name we still acknowledge 
That burst our bonds asunder, 
And loudly sing 
Our conq'ring King, 
In songs of joy and wonder, 
In every day's deliverance 
Our Jesus we discover;
Tis He, tis He That smote the sea, 
And led us safely over. 

While in affliction's furnace, 
And passing through the fire,  
Thy love we praise, 
Which knows our days 
And ever brings us nigher. 
We clap our hands exulting
In Thine almighty favour;
The love divine which made us Thine,
Shall keep us Thine for ever. 

By faith we see the glory 
To which Thou shalt restore us; 
The Cross despise for that high prize 
Which Thou has set before us. 
And if Thou count us worthy, 
We each, as dying Stephen, 
Shall see Thee stand 
At God's right hand 
To take us up to heaven.

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">There's a wind a-blowing 
All across the land 
Fragrant breeze of heaven 
Blowing once again 
Don't know where it comes from 
Don't know where it goes 
But let it blow over me 
O sweet wind come and blow over me 

There's a rain a-pouring
Showers from above 
Mercy drops are coming
Mercy drops of love 
Turn your face to heaven 
Let the water pour 
Well let it pour over me 
O sweet rain come and pour over me 

There's a fire burning
Falling from the sky 
Awesome tongues of fire
Consuming you and I 
Can you feel it burning 
Burn the sacrifice 
Well let it burn over me  
O sweet fire come and burn over me

My soul is longing and fainting 
The courts of the Lord to see
My heart and flesh they are singing 
For joy to the living God
How lovely is Thy dwelling place 
O Lord of hosts to me.

Even the sparrow finds a home 
Where he can settle down
And the swallow she can build a nest 
Where she may lay her young
Within the courts of the Lord of hosts, 
My king my Lord and my God
And happy are those who are dwelling 
Where the song of praise is sung

I'd rather be a door-keeper and only stay a day
Than live the life of a sinner and have to stay away
For the Lord is shining as the sun 
And the Lord He's like a shield
And no good things does He withhold 
From those who walk His way</attribute>

I see men from every nation 
Bowing down before the throne 
Like the sound of many waters 
Like the rushing wind around us 
Multitudes join the song 
And a symphony of praise arises 
Tears are wiped away from eyes 
As men from every tongue 
And tribe now sing 

Holy holy God Almighty 
Who was who is and is to come 
All the angels are crying holy 
To the lamb who sits upon the throne 
Holy holy God Almighty 
Who was who is and is to come 
All creation is bringing glory 
To the Lamb who sits upon the throne

I see One who's full of wonder
Eyes of fire and voice of thunder
Shining bright His majesty
All the colours of the rainbow
Circle Him and fill His temple
Beautiful this is to me
And a symphony of praise arises 
Tears are wiped away from eyes

Triumphed over judgement by Your blood

My heart shall be Thy throne

A stranger going through
Not of this world am I 
Since I am Thine
Weaned from its passing show 
Transformed Thy love to know
Hold thou my hand in Thine

Choose Thou the path I tread

Help me to follow on

When evil foes assail
And almost would prevail
In that dark hour be Thou
My strength and shield
Lend then Thy strong embrace
Uphold me by Thy grace
In weakness be my strength
O mighty Saviour

Thy blessed will divine
With joy I make it mine
My heart shall be Thy throne
And Thine alone
Choose Thou the path I tread
And whither I am led
Help me to follow on

Yea choose the path for me
Although I may not see
The reason Thou dost will to lead me so
I know the toilsome way
Will lead to realms of day
Where I shall dwell with Thee

My heart shall be Thy throne

My great Redeemer's praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace!

My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honours of Thy name.

Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease;
'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
'Tis life, and health, and peace.

He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean,
His blood availed for me.

Hear Him, ye deaf;
His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Saviour come,
And leap, ye lame, for joy.</attribute>

So you love this city and you love these streets.
Every child out playing by their own front door
Every baby laying on the bedroom floor.

Every dreamer dreaming in her dead-end job
Every driver driving through the rush hour mob
I feel it in my spirit, feel it in my bones
You're going to send revival, bring them all back home

I can hear that thunder in the distance
Like a train on the edge of town
I can feel the brooding of Your Spirit
"Lay your burdens down, Lay your burdens down".

From the Preacher preaching when the well is dry
To the lost soul reaching for a higher high
From the young man working through his hopes and fears
To the widow walking through the veil of tears

Every man and woman, every old and young
Every fathers daughter, every mothers son.
I feel it in my spirit, feel it in my bones
You're going to send revival, bring them all back home

Like a train on the edge of town
I can feel the brooding of Your Spirit

Every cry, You are listening
No matter what state my heart is in

With words that are true 
And a hope that is real
As I feel Your touch
You bring a freedom 
To all that's within

In the safety of this place

Pour out my heart to say that I need You
Pour out my heart to say that I'm thankful
Pour out my heart to say that You're wonderful</attribute>

No fragrant morning noon or dappled ev'ning
Compare in any facet with the Son

Redeemed Thine own creation with Thy blood 
Restoring man belov'd of God the Father 
Reviled and placed upon a cross of wood 

Now have I seen Thee in the sanctu'ry 
O God most high more dear than any one 
Resplendent Lord surpassing thought or concept
Receive the sacrifice of Thine own Son 

Within these walls of time we live and move 
Receding limits as we gaze on Thee 
For through the flesh of our imperfect being 
There breaketh knowledge of Eternity 

So shall I praise Thee love Thee and adore
Till life is through and limits lose their hold 
And standing there at last alone before Thee 
My praises shall for ever more unfold

But through suffering death and sorrow 
He has rent the veil in two. 

O behold the man of sorrows, 
O behold Him in plain view, 
Lo! He is the Mighty Conq'ror, 
Since He rent the veil in two. 

Yes, He is with God, the Father, 
Interceding there for you;
For He is the Mighty Conqueror, 
Since He rent the veil in two. 

O behold the man of sorrows, 
O behold Him in plain view, 
Lo! He is the Mighty Conq'ror, 
Since He rent the veil in two. 

Holy angels bow before Him, 
Men of earth give praises due;
For He is the well beloved, 
Since He rent the veil in two. 

O behold the man of sorrows, 
O behold Him in plain view, 
Lo! He is the Mighty Conq'ror, 
Since He rent the veil in two. 

Throughout time and endless ages, 
Heights and depths of love so true;
He alone can be the giver, 
Since He rent the veil in two

So they knew from the start
This road would not lead to fame
All they really knew for sure was Jesus had called to them
He said "Come follow me" and they came
With reckless abandon they came

Empty nets lying there at the waters edge
Told a story that few could believe and none could explain
How some crazy fishermen agreed to go where Jesus lead
With no thought for what they would gain
For Jesus had called them by name and they answered

[Chorus:]
We will abandon it all for the sake of the call
No other reason at all but the sake of the call
Wholly devoted to live and to die
For the sake of the call

Drawn like the rivers are drawn to the sea
No turning back for the water cannot help but flow
Once we hear the Savior's call we'll follow wherever he leads
Because of the love He has shown
And because he has called us to go we will answer

We will abandon it all for the sake of the call
No other reason at all but the sake of the call
Wholly devoted to live and to die

[Bridge:]
Not for the sake of a creed or a cause
Not for a dream or a promise
Simply because it is Jesus who calls
And if we believe we'll obey

We will abandon it all for the sake of the call
No other reason at all but the sake of the call
Wholly devoted to live and to die

But downward bends His burning eye
At mysteries so bright

Crown Him the Lord of peace
Whose power a sceptre sways 
From pole to pole that wars may cease
And all be prayer and praise

And round His pierced feet 
Fair flowers of paradise extend 
Their fragrance ever sweet

As we come before Your throne to worship You
By Your Spirit's power You now draw our hearts
And we hear Your voice in triumph ringing clear

I am He that liveth
That liveth and was dead
Behold I am alive for ever more

There we see You stand
Mighty risen Lord
Clothed in garments pure and holy shining bright
Eyes of flashing fire
Feet like burnished bronze
And the sound of many waters is Your voice

I am He that liveth
That liveth and was dead
Behold I am alive for ever more

Like the shining sun, in its noonday strength
We now see the glory of Your wondrous face
Once that face was marred
But now You're glorified
And Your words like a two-edged sword
Have mighty power

I am He that liveth
That liveth and was dead
Behold I am alive for ever more</attribute>

All you servants of the Lord
Who minister by night within His house 
Lift up your hands within the sanctuary

Lift up your hands within the sanctuary 
And praise the Lord

We praise You Lord

Not a proud heart not a proud eye 
No concern for things too great for me

Hope is in the Lord O Israel

The wind began to blow 
The sea was loud and angry 
And this one thing I know 
We would have died there 
As we fought the angry sea 
Until He arose and all was peace 

And suddenly peace and calm 
Suddenly still my heart began to see 
And suddenly holy light
Shining like sun so bright 
Suddenly peace 
Suddenly calm 
Suddenly Christ

I whispered to the others 
Who is this righteous man 
That the sea in all its anger 
Dies away at His command 
We would have died there 
As we fought the angry sea 
Until He arose and all was peace 

And suddenly peace and calm 
Suddenly still my heart began to see 
And suddenly holy light
Shining like sun so bright 
Suddenly peace 
Suddenly calm 
Suddenly Christ

Suddenly peace

There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Would you o'er evil a victory win?
There's wonderful power in the blood

There is power, power wonder working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power, power wonder working power
In the precious blood of the Lamb

Would you be free from your passion and pride?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide
There's wonderful power in the blood

There is power, power wonder working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power, power wonder working power
In the precious blood of the Lamb

Would you be whiter much whiter than snow?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Sin stains are lost in its life-giving flow
There's wonderful power in the blood

There is power, power wonder working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power, power wonder working power
In the precious blood of the Lamb

Would you do service for Jesus your King?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Would you live daily His praises to sing?
There's wonderful power in the blood

There is power, power wonder working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power, power wonder working power
In the precious blood of the Lamb






And that blood will never lose its power
No never, no never
Jesus blood avails for sin forever
And will never lose its power</attribute>

Though Satan should buffet 
If trials should come 
Let this blest assurance control 
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate
And hath shed His own blood for my soul 

It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

My sin - oh the bliss of this glorious thought 
My sin not in part but the whole 
Is nailed to His cross and I bear it no more 
Praise the Lord 
Praise the Lord O my soul 

It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

For me be it Christ be it Christ hence to live 
If Jordan above me shall roll 
No pang shall be mine for in death as in life 
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul 

It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

But Lord, 'tis for Thee
For Thy coming we wait 
The sky not the grave is our goal
O trump of the angel O voice of the Lord
Blessed hope blessed rest of my soul

Rebuilding the temple of praise

The lowly and the humble
Shall inherit all the earth

While injustice raised its head
For the ones who cried in hunger

Give my praise to the fountain of delights
For in my helplessness You heard my cry
And waves of mercy poured down on my life

Beautiful Saviour
Wonderful Counsellor
Clothed in majesty
Lord of history
You're the way, the truth, the life
Star of the morning
Glorious in holiness
You're the risen One
Heaven's champion
And You reign, You reign over all

I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer
I will sing of the blood that never fails
Of sins forgiven, of conscience cleansed
Of death defeated
And life without end

Beautiful Saviour
Wonderful Counsellor
Clothed in majesty
Lord of history
You're the way, the truth, the life
Star of the morning
Glorious in holiness
You're the risen One
Heaven's champion
And You reign, You reign over all

I long to be where the praise is never ending
Yearn to dwell, where the glory never fades
Where countless worshipers will share one song
And cries of "worthy" will honour the Lamb

Cleanse your heart and your soul
In the fountain that flows
For you and for me and for all

At the wonderful tragic mysterious tree
On that beautiful scandalous night you and me
Were atoned by His blood and forever washed white
On that beautiful scandalous night

On the hillside you will be delivered
At the foot of the cross justified
And your spirit restored
By the river that pours
From our blessed Saviour’s side

Where my faith and real life meet
Sometimes hope seems out of reach
I hear the growing cry for freedom
Am I equal to the call?
Where's the love that conquers all?
It's so easy to be human, so human to give in
But when I reach beyond my weakness
I'm reminded once again

The power is still where it's always been
The Word is alive, Jesus still lives
The power of His blood
Hasn't lessened or dimmed
It's where it's always been
It's where it's always been

Where's the passion for the mission?
Where's the fervour of our faith?
Where's the evidence of grace?
Where's the love that finds compassion
In the sea of human need?
Where's the truth that sets men free?
In a world that holds no answer
Every heart will someday find
That everything they long for
Has been there all the time

The power is still where it's always been
The Word is alive, Jesus still lives
The power of His blood
Hasn't lessened or dimmed
It's where it's always been
It's where it's always been

There's a cross that I can hold to
There's a reason to believe
There's an empty grave that's calling out to me</attribute>

Drawn from Emmanuel’s veins
And sinners plunged beneath that flood 
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains.

The dying thief rejoiced to see 
That fountain in his day
And there have I, though vile as he
Washed all my sins away
Washed all my sins away
Washed all my sins away
And there have I, though vile as he
Washed all my sins away.

I do believe I will believe 
That Jesus died for me 
That on the cross He shed His blood 
From sin to set me free 
From sin to set me free 
From sin to set me free 
That on the cross He shed His blood 
From sin to set me free 

Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power
Till all the ransomed church of God 
Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more
Till all the ransomed church of God 
Be saved, to sin no more.

E’er since, by faith, I saw the stream 
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die.</attribute>

And life lies before us 
Like an unexplored adventure 
Time seems like a promise 
That we hold within our hand 
But we rarely understand 

That time and tide wait for no man 
Days pass swiftly 
Like a candle's flickering flame 
And who can say that this time
Of holy calling 
Will wait for a tomorrow 
Or on the tide be borne away 

To live to love we set our goals 
Never to be chained 
But be blown by winds of fancy 
Freedom is our promise 
And we hold it in our hand 
But we're building on the sand 

For time and tide wait for no man 
Days pass swiftly 
Like a candle's flickering flame 
And who can say that this time
Of holy calling 
Will wait for a tomorrow 
Or on the tide be borne away 

Till a high and holy call 
Falls on our cherished youthful days
And we realise that time is slipping by 
Fading into misted memory 
While Jesus stands and whispers 
Follow me, follow me

And time and tide wait for no man 
Days pass swiftly 
Like a candle's flickering flame 
And who can say that this time
Of holy calling 
Will wait for a tomorrow 
Or on the tide be borne away

He is my light my strength my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled when strivings cease
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save
Till on the cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I stand.</attribute>

Repeat

Alive, alive, dead but now arisen
He's alive, alive, living now in heaven

Come one and all to wonder at the grave they laid Him in
Come see the tomb is empty, He has triumphed over sin
The power of death has been defeated and forgiven now we sing
Oh hear us sing, He's risen from the dead

Alive, alive, dead but now arisen
He's alive, alive, living now in heaven
As we wait for Him to come again some day

Beaten, rejected, crucified
Scorned and afflicted
Left to die
Risen, victorious, King of life

Surrounded by Your Glory, what will my heart feel?
Will I dance for you, Jesus? Or in awe of You, be still?
Will I stand in Your presence, or to my knees will I fall?
Will I sing 'Hallelujah!'? Will I be able to speak at all?
I can only imagine! O Lord, I can only imagine!

I can only imagine when all I will do
Is forever, forever worship You

Coming out of Heaven from God 
Shining to lighten the nations 
Shining like the morning sun 

And those streets they wait for an army
Returning from war in the night 
And her King will sound the trumpet 
I can hear, I can hear it 

And I dream that these streets
All burn with glory 
I dream of a fire in the night 
And I dream of the Spirit in the country 
Holy light, come holy light 

Drink O land, rain of Heaven 
Thirsty land, drink your fill 
Come holy light 

And I dream that these streets
All burn with glory (Drink O land) 
I dream of a fire in the night 
(Rain of Heaven) 
And I dream of the Spirit in the country (Thirsty land)

With the glory of the Lamb 
There's a way we can go there

No more suffering no more tears 
No more sin no more sickness 
No injustice no more death 
Because of You because of You 
Because of Your love because of Your blood

All our sins are washed away 
And we can live forever 
Now we have this hope because of You 
O we'll see You face to face 
And we will dance together 
In the city of our God because of You 

There is joy everlasting 
There is gladness there is peace 
There is wine ever flowing 
There's a wedding there's a feast

In an upper room 
Waiting for God's power from on high 
They were waiting for a promise
Made not so long before 
Jesus said He'd come  
And set their souls on fire 
Suddenly the sound of wind came rushing in 
And their hearts were set aflame 
And to them He gave the power
When they called upon His name 

Suddenly, I can feel His mighty power 
Suddenly, I can feel a change within 
And I know that I will never 
Never be the same again 
You can find all you need at the altar 
Leave behind every weight that presses in 
For the Spirit of the Lord is still moving suddenly 

Never let your heart be troubled
No need to be afraid 
When you feel you don't have
Strength to carry on 
There is glory in His presence
There is healing in His love 
He's our anchor and our peace in every storm 
So my friend call on the Lord 
And trust His word 
From age to age He's still the same 
For He's a God who loves us
A God who hears us 
There's power in His name 

Suddenly, I can feel His mighty power 
Suddenly, I can feel a change within 
And I know that I will never 
Never be the same again

Where I could find a way

He said that I could come 
Into His presence without fear 
Into the Holy place 
Where His mercy hovers near 
I'm running, I'm running 
I'm running to the mercy seat 
Where Jesus is calling 
He said His grace would cover me 
His blood will flow freely 
It will provide the healing 
I'm running to the mercy seat 
I'm running to the mercy seat

Are you living where hope has not been 
Lost in the curse of a lifetime of sin 
Lovely illusions they never come true 
I know where there's a place 
Of mercy for you 

He said that you could come 
Into His presence without fear 
Into the Holy place 
Where His mercy hovers near 
Come running, come running 
Come running to the mercy seat 
Where Jesus is calling 
His grace will be a covering 
His blood will flow freely

I cannot find in my own

To melt this heart of stone 
Keeps me aching with a yearning 
Keeps me glad to have been caught 
In the reckless raging fury 
That they call the love of God 

Now I've seen no band of angels 
But I've heard the soldiers' songs 
Love hangs over them like a banner 
Love within them leads them on 
To the battle on the journey 
And it's never gonna stop 
Ever widening their mercies 
And the fury of His love 

Oh the love of God 
Oh, the love of God 
The love of God 

Joy and sorrow are this ocean 
And in their every ebb and flow 
Now the Lord a door has opened 
That all Hell could never close 
Here I'm tested and made worthy 
Tossed about but lifted up 
In the reckless raging fury 
That they call the love of God

We have cried for Your compassion
To renew the land again
Now we're standing in Your presence 
More hungry than before
Now we're on the steps of mercy
And we're knocking at Your door.

How long, before You drench the barren land?
How long, before we see Your righteous hand?
How long, before Your name is lifted high?
How long, before the weeping turns to songs of joy?

Lord we know Your heart is broken
By the evil that You see
And you've stayed Your hand of judgement
For You plan to set men free.
But the land is still in darkness
And we've fled from what is right
We have failed the silent children
Who will never see the light.

How long, before You drench the barren land?
How long, before we see Your righteous hand?
How long, before Your name is lifted high?
How long, before the weeping turns to songs of joy?

But I know a day is coming
When the deaf will hear His voice
When the blind will see their Saviour
And the lame will leap for joy.
When the widow finds a Husband
Who will always love His bride
And the orphan finds a Father
Who will never leave her side. 

How long, before Your glory lights the skies?
How long, before Your radiance lifts our eyes?
How long, before Your fragrance fills the air?
How long, before the earth resounds with songs of joy?

Heaven and earth will pass away
In a moment suddenly
Comes the sound of jubilee

Sound the trumpet
Sound the trumpet
Heaven's gates are open wide
He is coming He is returning
Glory to the Lamb who died

Conscious now of earthly things
Till we see the King of Kings
Such a long time so it seemed
Now hear the song of the redeemed

Sound the trumpet
Sound the trumpet
Heaven's gates are open wide
He is coming He is returning
Glory to the Lamb who died

In this day in which we stand
We cry out from every land
Songs of triumph
Songs of love
One day we will sing above

Sound the trumpet
Sound the trumpet
Heaven's gates are open wide
He is coming He is returning
Glory to the Lamb who died

Thank you for this day of grace
'Till we see You face to face
Hasten Lord the wedding day
When we meet You in the way

He is coming He is returning
Glory to the Lamb who died</attribute>

Than all this world has known
Where faithful ones from every tongue
Will one day come
Before the Son we'll stand
Made faultless through the Lamb
Believing hearts find promised grace
Salvation comes

Hear heaven's voices sing
Their thunderous anthem rings
Through emerald courts and sapphire skies
Their praises rise
All glory, wisdom, power
Strength, thanks and honour are
To God our King who reigns on high
For evermore

And there we'll find our home
Our life before the throne
We'll honour Him in perfect song
Where we belong
He'll wipe each tear-stained eye
As thirst and hunger die
The Lamb becomes our Shepherd King
We'll reign with Him

Hear heaven's voices sing
Their thunderous anthem rings
Through emerald courts and sapphire skies
Their praises rise
All glory, wisdom, power
Strength, thanks and honour are
To God our King who reigns on high

And now our voices sing
Our grateful anthem rings
Through earthly courts and clouded skies
Our praises rise
All glory, wisdom, power

Where the grapes of wrath are stored 
He hath loosed the fateful lightning 
Of His terrible swift sword 
His truth is marching on 

Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah

He has sounded forth the trumpet 
That shall never sound retreat 
He is sifting out the hearts of men 
Before His judgement seat 
O be swift my soul to answer Him 
Be jubilant my feet 
Our God is marching on

Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
Our God is marching on

In the beauty of the lilies 
Christ was born across the sea 
With a glory in His bosom 
That transfigures you and me 
As He died to make men holy 
Let us live to make men free 
While God is marching on 

Glory, glory hallelujah

He is coming like the glory 
Of the morning on the wave 
He is wisdom to the mighty 
He is succour to the brave 
All the world shall be His footstool 
And the sword of time His slave

Behind the heavenly veil
Sat the ark of the covenant 
Where the most high dwells 
But only the high priest could enter therein 
To offer up a sacrifice of atonement for sin 
But the veil was rent in an instant 
Revealing the holy place 
On a hill nearby on a rugged cross 
Justice met grace 

Now I can go into the holy of holies 
I can kneel and make my petition known 
I can go into the holy of holies
And although I'm just a common man 
Because of God's redemption plan 
I can boldly approach the throne 

For the blood of sacrifices 
Is now no longer required 
For the blood of Christ God's spotless Lamb 
Has opened heaven's door 
Allowing us to enter in
To the presence of the Lord 

Now I can go into the holy of holies 
I can kneel and make my petition known 
I can go into the holy of holies

For Thou art all to me

Is there on earth a closer bond than this
That my beloved's mine and I am His

But chiefly Thine 
That through Thy sacrifice
Thou Lord art mine
By Thine own cords of love so sweetly wound
Around me I to Thee am closely bound

To Thee, Thou dying Lamb 
I all things owe
All that I have and am
And all I know
All that I have is now no longer mine
And I am not my own, Lord I am Thine

How can I Lord withhold
Life's brightest hour
From Thee or gathered gold
Or any power?
Why should I keep one precious thing from Thee
When Thou hast given Thine own dear self for me

I pray Thee Saviour keep
Me in thy love
Until death's holy sleep
Shall me remove
To that fair realm where, sin and sorrow o'er
Thou and Thine own are one for evermore

No matter what others may say,
Your darkest sins will be forgiven
You will always have a place.

At the table of grace the cup’s never empty.
The plate’s always full and it’s never too late.
To come and be filled with love never ending
You’re always welcome at the table of grace.

So come you weak, and heavy hearted
Don’t try to hide your earthly scars.
In His eyes, we all are equal
Don’t be afraid, come as you are.

At the table of grace the cup’s never empty.
The plate’s always full, and it’s never too late.
To come and be filled with love never ending
You’re always welcome at the table of grace.

So let the first become the last
Let the poor put kings to shame.
Their willing hearts will be their treasure
By the power of Jesus’ name!

At the table of grace the cup’s never empty
The plate’s always full, and it’s never too late!
To come and be filled with love never ending
You’re always welcome at the table of grace

At the table of grace the cup’s never empty.
The plate’s always full, and it’s never too late
To come and be filled with love never ending:
You’re always welcome at the table of grace
Everyone’s welcome at the table of grace.</attribute>

A river of blessing a river of love 
Tis reaching the nations both far and near
This river of God O let it flow here 

O river of God flow down on me 
O river of God flow out from me 
O river of God so full and free 
O river of God I cry to thee

The desert shall blossom as fresh as the rose 
This river brings healing wherever it flows 
The ground that is parched so thirsty and dry 
Shall surely be flooded with rain from on high 

O river of God flow down on me 
O river of God flow out from me 
O river of God so full and free 
O river of God I cry to thee

The deaf shall have hearing 
The blind folk shall see 
The lame shall be loosed from their infirmity 
The crooked made straight 
And the broken made whole 
This latter time blessing as promised by Joel 

O river of God flow down on me 
O river of God flow out from me 
O river of God so full and free 
O river of God I cry to thee

The fetters of fear and of doubt soon shall break 
When unbelief goes and the church shall awake 
The chains of hard bondage forever will fall 
And Jesus exalted supreme over all 

O river of God flow down on me 
O river of God flow out from me 
O river of God so full and free 
O river of God I cry to thee

By this flowing river earth's bondage shall cease 
The floods are now rising to bring us release 
The vision is glorious then why not believe
Step into the blessing His fullness receive

O river of God flow down on me 
O river of God flow out from me 
O river of God so full and free 
O river of God I cry to thee

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">Can you hear the sound of heaven 
Like the sound of many waters 
It's the sound of worship 
Coming from the throne 
There are cries of adoration 
As men from every nation 
Lift their voice to make
His glory known, singing 

Holy holy holy are You Lord 
Holy holy holy are You Lord 
The elders and angels bow 
The redeemed worship You now 
Holy holy holy are You Lord

        <attribute name="lyrics" type="string">When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of Glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss 
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it Lord that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my Lord:
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet ,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were an offering far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

Lift up a shout of praise 
For the Bridegroom will come
The glorious One 
And O we will look on His face 
We'll go to a much better place 

Dance with all your might 
Lift up your hands and clap for joy 
For the time's drawing near
When He will appear 
And O we will stand by His side 
A strong pure spotless Bride 

O we will dance on  
The streets that are golden 
The glorious Bride
And the great son of Man 
From every tongue and tribe and nation 
Will join in the song of the Lamb

(Men-Women echo) 
Sing aloud for the time of rejoicing is near
The risen King our Groom is soon to appear 
The wedding feast to come is now near at hand
Lift up your voice proclaim the coming Lamb

O we will dance on  
The streets that are golden 
The glorious Bride
And the great son of Man 
From every tongue and tribe and nation 
Will join in the song of the Lamb

How beautiful You are to me?

Jesus, dearer to my heart than anything
Sweeter than springtime
Purer than sunshine
Ever my song will be
Jesus You're beautiful to me

So beautiful x3
Jesus You’re beautiful to me

Blooming for me
Jesus it is the emblem of Thee
Beautiful flower fairest that grows
I'm glad that I've found Thee 
Sweet Sharon's rose

Oft have I wandered
O'er life's rough way
Like a lost sheep
That had gone astray
Till one glad day 
I found repose
Now in my heart
Blooms Sharon's rose

Sweet rose of Sharon
Blooming for me
Jesus it is the emblem of Thee
Beautiful flower fairest that grows
I'm glad that I've found Thee 
Sweet Sharon's rose

Bloom on sweet flower and point the way
To that fair land of perfect day
Where I shall lift my longing gaze
On Sharon's rose through endless days

Consider all the works Thy hand hath made
I see the stars I hear the mighty thunder 
Thy power throughout the universe display'd 

Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee 
How great Thou art, how great Thou art 
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee 
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

And when I think 
That God His Son not sparing 
Sent Him to die
I scarce can take it in 
That on the cross my burden gladly bearing 
He bled and died to take away my sin 

Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee 
How great Thou art, how great Thou art 
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee 
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

When Christ shall come 
With shout of acclamation 
And take me home 
What joy shall fill my heart 
Then shall I bow in humble adoration 
And there proclaim my God how great Thou art

Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee 
How great Thou art, how great Thou art 
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee 
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
